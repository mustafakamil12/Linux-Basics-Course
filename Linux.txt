# u need to learn 2 text editor at least 
 1. vi
 2. nano

# The most important features that make Linux so powerfull is the pipes and redirection for ip/op

# let's talk about redirection first

# any programs running by linux kernl have 3 channels
 1. STDIN ---> 0
 2. STDOUT ---> 1
 3. STDERR ---> 2

# if u wanna to print anything on the screen just use 
> echo "some string here"

# now to redirect the output from the command above to a file for example 
> echo "some string" 1> file_name.***
# or
> echo "some string" > file_name.***

# single > use to overwrite the file content.

# double >> use to append to a file content.
> echo "some string" >> file_name.***

# using > or >> that's mean STDOUT, mean normal output, it will never redirect the error output, if u need to capture or redirect
# the error use (2>) for example: 
> ls -lah file_name_not_exist 2> errorfile
> ls -alh tena.txt 2> yoyo.txt  <-- wehre tena.txt is not available and yoyo.txt is exist.

# another example for redirection: 
> echo "This is message text" > message.txt
> mail -s "email subject" <email_address> < message.txt

> sudo less /var/mail/$(whoami) <-- to read email on local


# btw the direction of input or out put can be detrmine using (< or >)

# let's talk about pipes now

# to view all system processes by using process status ps

> ps aux  <-- where a -> all processes, u -> convert user id to user name, x -> show me processes even they are not attached to 
																				terminal (tty)
# now u'll see the page is full with information, so we can resolve this by using the pipe
> ps aux | less

# what happen above is like this
 - it's take the ouput from the output channel 1 -- hocked up to (|) --> input channel 0

# u can use multi pipes to filter the result as u need 
> ps aux | uniq | sort | grep "something to search"																		

# another useful thing is to use logic to control program executing sequence
> prog1 && prog2 <-- This mean if program1 run successfully that's mean it's result True, Then run prog2,

# in case of prog1 is not working or failed that's mean it's result False, and so prog2 will not be running :)
> ls somefile.txt && echo "astonishing success"

# now if u have a file contain multi lines and these lines contain a delimiter like (:)
> cat <file_name> | cut -d: -f2
# it will return the second part after delimiter.

# another option really useful it's (sort)
> cat <file_name> | sort -bf   <-- where b is ignoring lead white space and f mean incase sensitve

# if we have a dublicate within a file, u can use uniq to print a uniqu line 
> cat <file_name> | uniq

# u can use word count <wc> to get some information about the file like # of lines ..etc
> wc <file_name> --> the result will contain newline, word, and byte counts for each file

# grep is a searching, finding and filtiring tool
> cat <file_name> | grep "something to search or filter"

# u can use grep to look for a word or patteren in all files in a directory
> grep something ./*   <-- this line mean search for the word something in all files in this directory.

# we can also make linux don't show the dublicate as well remove any unwanted thing on the lines show in the screen
> grep someone ./* | uniq | cut -d: -f1

# if we need to look for a word or a pattern in all subdirectories
> grep -r ISA ./* | cut -d: -f1  <-- where I'm looking for ISA word in the main directory and subdirctories.

# some of the system admin tasks
 1. update system, u will not be allowd to do so unless u have root power permissions
	> apt-get update
	> sudo apt-get update   <-- where sudo is super user do :)

 2. upgrade system to latest release
 	> sudo apt-get upgrade

 3. install new application or software
 	> sudo apt-get install <software_name>

 4. search for application or software
 	> sudo apt-cache search <software_name>

 	# The apt-cache command line tool is used for searching apt software package cache. In simple words, this tool is used to search software packages, collects information of packages and also used to search for what available packages are ready for installation on Debian or Ubuntu based systems. 

 5. u can install multi software and programs at the sametime
 	> sudo apt-get install prog1 software2 prog3 ...etc

 6. to get a list of all servers that we are dealing with when we install or update software
 	> cat /etc/apt/sources.list

 7. to remove stuff that been installed already on the system
 	> sudo apt-get remove <prog or software>

 8. if the application or the software from a special repo not in the apt-get we can use the recommended commands in their website
 	> sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommend <-- where this option mean only the main dependencies

# let's talk about file permission, if u use ls -l (where -l mean long) u can see something like this
drwxrwxr-x  ==> it will be read like this    (d) 		(rwx)     (rwx)       (r-x)
																			 file-type		owner  owner-group   other-user
																			 d: directory
																			 -: file
																			 l: link

# keep in mind any new file created it will be redable by other users by default, as admin u need to disable this
# to change file mod permission use 
> chmod <permission> file

# to change folder mod permission
> chmod <permission> folder
# OR
> chmod -R <permission> folder   <-- this will be reflected on the folder and all files inside it :)

# for each of: owner, owner group and other user, we using 3 chars, r w x ==> 1 1 1 so these binary values vary from 
0 0 0 --> 1 1 1  :)

# the original mode for a file is (664)

# if u tiered from changing file permission mode everytime that u create file, u need to 
 1. edit the file below:
 	> nano /etc/login.defs

 2. search for umask which mean user mask, it's actually a mask put over the file permission
 	it's job is to subtract it's value from the file permission value.

 3. the default value of umask is 022

 4. u can change owner and group as well using 
 	> chown owner:group <file_name or dir_name>

# ---------------------------------------------------------- Access Control --------------------------------------------------

# everything in linux is object, each object have owner

# if u change directory to the root, and submit the command <ls -l> u can see that all directories there owned by root and the 
  group is root as well

# in contrast if u change directory to ur home directory u can see all directories there owned by u and ur group

# when u create a user, a group will be generated automatically with same name.

# easly u can find who u are by using 
> whoami

# or for more details u can use id, where it give u a lot of information like user, group and other groups user member in
> id

# to find out what's make a user in the linux system. actually there're 3 files should we look into

# to change from current user to the root
> sudo -i

# to exit from root user 
> exit

# the 3 files that responsible for user
 1. /etc/passwd
 	> tail /etc/passwd

 	# from the command above u will get a lot of information like
 	mustafa:   x    :1000:1000,mustafa,,,:/home/mustafa:  /bin/bash
 	user    password uid  gid  user info  home directory  default shell

 	# to see all users in the system
 	> cat /etc/passwd

 	# and get the total lines by using word count command:da
 	> cat /etc/passwd | wc -l

 2. /etc/shadow
 	> tail /etc/shadow

 	# in this file we can see the hash password :) 
 	
 	# The /etc/shadow file contains one entry per line, each representing a user account.

 	# Typically, the first line describes the root user, followed by the system and normal user accounts. New entries are appended 
 	  at the end of the file.

 	# Each line of the /etc/shadow file contains nine comma-separated fields:

 	mustafa:$6$ZvyX59HxR8CoBxfg$1BgfZZv0cdmxgOVCPkr1rf3RQeXljJswa1XAKYrmlSlClAtVLKo98nHOBrbZUHn.6UI/r553wmX8NdrGsyr1n1:18708:0:99999:7:::
 	
 	mark:$6$.n.:17736:0:99999:7:::
	[--] [----] [---] - [---] ----
	|      |      |   |   |   |||+-----------> 9. Unused
	|      |      |   |   |   ||+------------> 8. Expiration date
	|      |      |   |   |   |+-------------> 7. Inactivity period
	|      |      |   |   |   +--------------> 6. Warning period

	|      |      +--------------------------> 3. Last password change
	|      +---------------------------------> 2. Encrypted Password
	+----------------------------------------> 1. Username


  1. Username. The string you type when you log into the system. The user account that exist on the system.

	2. Encrypted Password. The password is using the $type$salt$hashed format. $type is the method cryptographic hash algorithm and can have the following values:

	$1$ – MD5
	$2a$ – Blowfish
	$2y$ – Eksblowfish
	$5$ – SHA-256
	$6$ – SHA-512
	
	If the password field contains an asterisk (*) or exclamation mark (!), the user will not be able to login to the system using password authentication. Other login methods like key-based authentication or switching to the user are still allowed.

	to disable any account just put (!) before the encrypted password :)

	In older Linux systems, the user’s encrypted password was stored in the /etc/passwd file.

	3. Last password change. This is the date when the password was last changed. The number of days is counted since January 1, 1970 (epoch date).

	4. Minimum password age. The number of days that must pass before the user password can be changed. Typically it is set to zero, which means that there is no minimum password age.

	5. Maximum password age. The number of days after the user password must be changed. By default, this number is set to 99999.

	6. Warning period. The number of days before the password expires during which the user is warned that the password must be changed.

	7. Inactivity period. The number of days after the user password expires before the user account is disabled. Typically this field is empty.

	8. Expiration date. The date when the account was disabled. It is represented as an epoch date.

	9. Unused. This field is ignored. It is reserved for future use.

	The /etc/shadow file should not be edited by hand unless you know what you are doing. Always use a command that is designed for the purpose. For example, to change a user password, use the passwd command, and to change the password aging information, use the chage command.

	# Example:

	linuxize:$6$zHvrJMa5Y690smbQ$z5zdL...:18009:0:120:7:14::

	The entry above contains information about the user “linuxize” password:

	. The password is encrypted with SHA-512 (the password is truncated for better readability).
	. The password was last changed on April 23, 2019 - 18009.  > date -d @18009
	. There is no minimum password age.
	. The password must be changed at least every 120 days.
	. The user will receive a warning message seven days before the password expiration date.
	. If the user doesn’t attempt to login to the system 14 days after the password is expired, the account will be disabled.
	. There is no account expiration date.


 3. /etc/group
    > tail /etc/group

    # as user created, corresponding group created as well

    > less /etc/group

    # the command above will view group name and who's member in a specific group.




# to add user in the system
	> useradd -m -d /home/schnerg -u 1501 -g 66 -s /bin/bash schnerg
		-m create home directory
		-d </home/user directory name> define the home direcotry
		-u <uid> or user id to sync up with LDAP
		-g <gid> group id 
		-s </bin/bash> define the default shell <if u didn't define /bin/bash the default shell will be empty in /etc/password and user will get what default shell in the system
		- <user_name>

	> useradd -m -d /home/schnerg  -s /bin/bash schnerg
	> tail /etc/passwd
	> tail /etc/shadow
	> grep schnerg /etc/group
	> ls /home
	> ls /home/schnerg
		# u may be see a file here like examples.desktop
		# this file is coming from skel
			> ls /etc/skel

	# now we need to set password
	> passwd <user_name>
	> passwd schnerg

# to view home directories
	> ls /home

# to lock user account 
	> usermod -L <user_name>
	> usermod -L schnerg

# to unlock user account
	> usermod -U <user_name>
	> usermod -U schnerg

# to delete user from the system
	> userdel <user_name>
	# keep in mind the directory home will not be removed
	> grep schnerg /etc/passwd
	> grep schnerg /etc/shadow
	> grep schnerg /etc/group
	> ls -lt /home  <-- if u take look on the user and group u will not see name u will see ids only.

	# now we need to remove home directoy for schnerg
	> rm -rf /home/schnerg/

# to search for a preivous command in linux just press (ctrl+r), then type the command, if u press (ctrl+r) again u'll get next.

# btw u can add user using script with command (newusers)

next must start with lesson 15

# --------------------------------------------------- Scheduling Tasks with Cron  --------------------------------------------

# to schedul a task in linux we need to add this task to the crontab

# to list or view what in the crontab use:
	> crontab -l
	no crontab for osboxes  <-- we got this because we dont' have anything in the crontab.

# no to edit the crontab we are going to use 
	> crontab -e

# let's take a look on the crontab anatomy

# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name  command to be executed

# the user-name field available only in the system crontab --> /etc/crontab


# if u use * in any of the fields above except the command, that's mean run always in that field. for ex if u place * in day of month that's mean it will run on daily basis.

# let's do this for example:
	*  *  *  *  * echo "hi there" >> /home/osboxes/hithere.txt

# to see another crontabs and where they kept:
	> ls /var/spool/cron/crontabs

# there's another place as well crontab can keept in
	> ls /etc/cron.d

# also there's system crontab in:
	> sudo nano /etc/crontab

# we can use range in the fields for example 
	15  10  1-10/2  *  5  echo "Hello There!" >> /home/osboxes/hithere.txt

	# the range in the day of month field mean every 1 to 10 days of the monthe on each 2 days

	# also u can use a list of days like 1,2,3,7


# cron.allow work like white list as well cron.deny work like black list.

# if you wanna to edit crontab for a user and u r sysadmin.	
	> crontab -e -u osboxes


# ---------------------------------------------------------- BASH Scripting --------------------------------------------------

# as it's mentinoed above it's bash because using bash command and scripting because we are going to these commands in programs.

# the first thing u need to do 
	> echo "Hello There!"

# in the case above both stdout and stderr directed to the command line, the same shell that we are in :)

# now if we wanna to store something using echo we need to direct output to a file.
	> echo "Hello There!" > hello.txt

# remeber if we need to append lines we need to use >> instead of > 

# now lets create a testfile and add some lines in it

# we can check how many lines in a file using many ways, but we can use this one below:
	> wc -l < testfile

# let's group the commands above and see the result
	> (cat testfile | wc -l)

# let's try to add more statement to the line above
	> (cat testfile | wc -l) && echo "Done!" 		<-- if the first part run successfully then the second part will be running.

# let's take a look on the same line code above but replace && <and> with <or> ||
	> (cat testfile | wc -l) || echo "Done!"		<-- if the first part run successfully or not the second part will be running.

# The points above is just applying logic & and | to the script

# when u redirect output of command using [>] u actually redirect stdout (1) or u can use 1> but if u wann to redirect errors use 2>

# to define a variable in shell programming use variable name and we can call it by add ($) before variable  --> $variable

# let's see how it's work, let's use one of the environment variable
	> echo $HOME
	# if u try to use the variable directly without using echo u'll get error coz linux will execute the contain of the variable
	> $HOME   (Error) trying to execute like this --> -bash: /home/osboxes: Is a directory

# let's take a look on the variable definition below
	> myvar="This is so wonderful!"		<-- don't use any space in this line
	> echo $myvar

	> somenumber=6
	> echo $somenumber

	> some_number=10
	>echo $some_number

	# let's take a look on the lines below
	> echo "My favorite number is $some_number"  							√
	> echo "This is my $some_numberth cup of tea today..."  	x
	> echo "This is my ${some_number}th cup of tea today..."  √

# we used in the previous examples fixed # (10) now let's take a look on the line below
	> echo "There are X of lines in the /etc/shadow file"
	# now the question is how we can get the real number of the shadow file instead of X

	> echo "There are `wc -l < /etc/group` of lines in the /etc/group file"
	# using back tick ` ` in the string line that's mean there's command need to be executed

	# we can play with execution command to assign it's output to variable
	> num_directories=`ls $HOME | wc -l`
	> echo $num_directories
	> ls $HOME

# now let's start to write an actual script

# now let's check where's our bash binary located
	> which bash

# create a simple bash script with name helloworld.sh and the content is:
	#!/usr/bin/bash

	#This is a comment
	echo "Hello World!"

	exit 0

# as any program or function we need to return something, to use return in bash script we will use exit.

# we can use numbers form 0-255 as returning value.

# as usual we using 0 as no issue or no problem return code

# any value between 1-255 mean that there's an issue with code, we can define error codes in docs.

# if we put exit only it will return the last functional command run.

# if we use this combine letters ($?) it will return the last functional command run.

# the script helloworld.sh will not work because of the permission, we need to add execute to it 
	> chmod +x helloworld.sh
	> ./helloworld.sh 
	> bash helloworld.sh

	# in the running case above if we try to echo any variable directly from terminal it will not working.

	# we can use another technique by using source 
	# source is take ur source code and execute it in the shell including ur variables.

	> source helloworld.sh  <-- but we need to remove exit statement first.
	# or we can use a shortcut by using dot
	> . helloworld.sh

	# the source technique above using with vpn for example to add all required variables to the active running bash.

# let's creare another bash script file called arguments.sh
	
	#!/usr/bin/bash
	
	## Arguments reference:
	# $# --> number of args that our script was run with
	# $0 --> the filename of our script
	# $1..$n --> script arguments
	
	# what's our filename?
	ourfilename=$0
	echo $ourfilename
	
	# how many arguments was the script
	num_arguments=$#
	echo $num_arguments
	
	# what were the arguments?
	echo "The first three arguments were ${1}, ${2} and ${3}
	echo $5"

# now if we change the file mod to be executable and then we change the name of the file it will keep file att. as it.

# bash script will not give you an error or notice, it's only give u blank

# now let's take a look on if statement.
	# the old way is to use 1 bracket and use one = for eauality.
	# u must add space after first bracket and before the last bracket
	# if we use $(...) that's mean run what ever within parentheses


# let's take a look about some useful parameters:
	# && and
	# || or

	# (())
	# ==    Is Equal To
	# !=    Is Not Equal To
	# <     Is Less Than
	# <=    Is Less Than Or Equal To
	# >     Is Greater Than
	# >=    Is Greater Than Or Equal To
	
	# $1, $2, $3, ... are the positional parameters.
	# "$@" is an array-like construct of all positional parameters, {$1, $2, $3 ...}.
	# "$*" is the IFS expansion of all positional parameters, $1 $2 $3 ....
	# $# is the number of positional parameters.
	# $- current options set for the shell.
	# $$ pid of the current shell (not subshell).
	# $_ most recent parameter (or the abs path of the command to start the current shell immediately after startup).
	# $IFS is the (input) field separator.
	# $? is the most recent foreground pipeline exit status.
	# $! is the PID of the most recent background command.
	# $0 is the name of the shell or shell script.

# ----------------------------------------------------------- PATH IN BASH  --------------------------------------------------

# let's take a look on sudo command, the question is how linux or bash understand what's sudo and where's sudo.
# to understand how the process done in linux bash, bash will look in env. variable PATH to reach out to sudo.
# let's take a look on the env. variable named $PATH which is like any other variable
	> echo $PATH

# the idea behind using PATH env. variable. is instead of using the full path with specific command we can use the command directly.
	> /usr/bin/sudo  
	> sudo

# to append path of a binaray or application to env. path variable. 
	> PATH=$PATH:/some/dir

# to prepend to the path and let linux look for what u add first, root is the first thing that linux is looking for
	> PATH=/root:$PATH

# one of the most important thing is how to modify the bash config file.
	> ~/.bash_profile or .profile

# anothe place to see is 
	> vi /etc/profile
	> vi /etc/profile.d
